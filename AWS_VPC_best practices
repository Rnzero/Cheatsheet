Multiple AZs — create subnets in 2+ AZs for high availability. 

NAT Gateway HA vs cost — 1 NAT per AZ gives better resilience; NAT gateways incur hourly & data charges. Balance cost vs availability. 

VPC Endpoints — use gateway endpoints for S3 and DynamoDB where possible to avoid NAT egress costs; use interface endpoints for other services. 

Tag everything for ownership, billing and automation.

VPC Flow Logs for network diagnostics / security logging. The module & CFN can enable flow logs. 

State and CI — store Terraform state remotely (S3 + DynamoDB) and pipeline changes through CI with approval steps. 

Test changes in lower envs — especially CIDR or route changes; some changes are disruptive.

Security — use Security Groups for instance-level controls; consider network ACLs only for coarse-grained control. See AWS VPC security best practices.
