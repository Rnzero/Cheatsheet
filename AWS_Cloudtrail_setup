> Setup Organization trail that writes to a central S3 bucket (or central CloudWatch/Log account) for easier queries/forensics.
> Decide retention, encryption (KMS), and lifecycle (S3 lifecycle) for CloudTrail logs.
> Decide what you must collect: Management events (all AWS API calls), Data events (S3 object reads/writes), EKS control plane logs, pod logs, VPC Flow Logs.


1) Create S3 for log retention: 
2) Create Cloud trail and point to the S3




******  Quick Setup:
$ aws cloudtrail create-trail --name org-trail --s3-bucket-name my-company-cloudtrail-logs-12345 --is-multi-region-trail
$ aws cloudtrail start-logging --name org-trail
